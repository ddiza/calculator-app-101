            <h2>What's My Story?</h2>
            <p>I am happily married after 20+ years. My beautiful wife & I have two smashingly amazing kids (twins...boy, girl). They are about  half-way through college. We currently live in New Braunfels, Texas. <br>I am a second generation Asian-American and grew up in Sugar Land, Texas. I served ten years in the US Army, stationed at various locations mostly in Central and North America. I attained the rank of captain, excelling in various battalion-level staff positions. After my commission ended, I worked mostly in civilian corporate roles, lastly as a logistician in supply chain management. I am fortunate to afford a career break so that I can skill-up towards an eventual tech role. </p>

            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <p>Other than parachuting out of perfectly flying objects (previous life), I am a recovering adrenaline junkie. For R&R, a group of us would do lots of day trips; we used to love sky diving on the weekends when I wore the uniform. My buddies & I would often free dive off of bridges during the summer. Shocking that I didn't sustain any major injuries. I do sound crazy sometimes so my wife will tell you I may have susteained some type of head injury. </p>

            <h2>How About Now?</h2>
            <p>What little free time I have, I do my best to get outside. I am a recreational triathlete. If I'm not camping or river tubing with family, and if there is time in the season to train up for events, this is my fitness program (swim/bike/run), but still prefer running to maintain my fitness in between seasons. I also love riding through the Texas hill country on my Indian Chieftain.<br>
